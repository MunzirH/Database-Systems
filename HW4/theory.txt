Part 3: Functional Dependency Theory

a.  R(A,B,C,D,E) with functional dependencies D → B, CE → A
A+ = A
B+ = B
C+ = C
D+ = BD because D → B
E+ = E
CE+ = CEA because CE → A
CED is the super key
D → B violates BCNF, D is not a superkey for R

Decompose R1:
R1(D, B) Only FD is D → B, it's in BCNF
R2(C,E,A,D) D → B doesn't apply, CE → A violates BCNF, 
CE is not a superkey for R

Decompose R2:
R3(C,E,A) key = CE Only FD is CE → A, it's in BCNF
R4(C,E,D) key = CED No FD, it's in BCNF

Final results:
R1(D, B)
R3(C,E,A)
R4(C,E,D)

b. S(A,B,C,D,E) with functional dependencies A → E, BC → A, DE → B
A+ = AE
B+ = B
C+ = C
D+ = D
E+ = E
BC+ = AEBC
DE+ = BDE
Superkey is BCD
A → E violates BCNF, A is not a superkey for S

Decompose S1:
S1(A,E) Only FD is A → E, it's in BCNF

Decompose S2:
S2(A,B,C) only FD is BC → A, it's in BCNF

Decompose S3:
S3(B,C,D)

c. All subsets of {A,B,C,D} are closed
A+ = A
B+ = B
C+ = C
D+ = D
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
d.(5 points) The only closed subsets of {A,B,C,D} are {} and {A,B,C,D}

A+ = B
B+ = C
C+ = D
D+ = A

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
e. The only closed subsets of {A,B,C,D} are {}, {B,C}, and {A,B,C,D}

A+ = B
B+ = A
C+ = ABC
D+ = BCD
