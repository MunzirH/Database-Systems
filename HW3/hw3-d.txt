In my opinion, DBMS makes it easy to create, open, and save new queries. Furthermore, it is simple to create the table and export/save your data.DBMS is great because it provides a high level of data security by protecting your valuable data from unauthorized access. Only authorized users should be granted access to the database via credentials. It also allows multiple users to access the same database at the same time without causing any conflicts. However, these benefits are due to the fact that I am using it for free. Making it public may be a bad idea because the data will no longer be as secure, which is the most important aspect of DBMS. }
